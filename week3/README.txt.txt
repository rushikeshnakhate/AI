P(H∣E)= P(E∣H)/P(E)  *	P(H).

prior probability
This relates the probability of the hypothesis before getting the evidence P(H), to the probability of the hypothesis after getting the evidence, P(H∣E). For this reason, P(H) is called the prior probability

posterior probability
 P(H∣E) is called the posterior probability
 
likelihood ratio
The factor that relates the two, P(E∣H)/p(E)is called the likelihood ratio. 

Using these terms, Bayes' theorem can be rephrased as "the posterior probability equals the prior probability times the likelihood ratio."







few important points 
posterior = likelihood *  prior /norm_marginal 
P(E---> is given so would come in denom always )
